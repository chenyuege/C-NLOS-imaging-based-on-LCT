    "## Abstract\n",
    "How to image objects that are hidden from a camera’s view is a problem of fundamental importance to many fields of research1–20, with applications in robotic vision, defence, remote sensing, medical imaging and autonomous vehicles. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging at macroscopic scales has been demonstrated by scanning a visible surface with a pulsed laser and a time-resolved detector14–19. Whereas light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems use such measurements to recover the shape of visible objects from direct reflections21–24, NLOS imaging reconstructs the shape and albedo of hidden objects from multiply scattered light. Despite recent advances, NLOS imaging has remained impractical owing to the prohibitive memory and processing requirements of existing reconstruction algorithms, and the extremely weak signal of multiply scattered light. Here we show that a confocal scanning procedure can address these challenges by facilitating the derivation of the light-cone transform to solve the NLOS reconstruction problem. This method requires much smaller computational and memory resources than previous reconstruction methods do and images hidden objects at unprecedented resolution. Confocal scanning also provides a sizeable increase in signal and range when imaging retroreflective objects. We quantify the resolution bounds of NLOS imaging, demonstrate its potential for real-time tracking and derive efficient algorithms that incorporate image priors and a physically accurate noise model. Additionally, we describe successful outdoor experiments of NLOS imaging under indirect sunlight. "

    "The time-resolved detector is a PDM series single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) from Micro Photon Devices with a 100 µm⇥ 100 µm active area, a reported 27 ps timing jitter (100 kHz laser at 675 nm), and 40.9 dark counts per second. Detection events are time stamped with 4ps temporal resolution using a PicoHarp 300 Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) module. The detected light is focused by a 75mm achromatic doublet (Thorlabs AC254-075-A-ML), and filtered using a laser line filter (Thorlabs FL670-10). The detection optics are co-axially aligned with an active light source using a polarized beamsplitter (Thorlabs PBS251). The light source (ALPHALAS PICOPOWER-LD-670-50) consists of a 670 nm wavelength pulsed laser diode with a reported pulse width of 30.6ps at a 10MHz repetition rate and 0.11mW average power. A 2-axis scanning galvonometer (Thorlabs GVS012) raster scans the illumination and detection spots across a wall located approximately 2m from the system at an oblique angle. The measured jitter of the entire system is approximately 60 ps without the laser line filter, and 200 ps with the filter on. We only use the filter for the outdoor experiments to reduce ambient light. The increase in jitter is due to the fact that the spectral transmission properties of the filter affect the temporal characteristics of the imaging system via the time-bandwidth product.16 An appropriate choice of spectral line filter and pulsed laser could mitigate this effect.\n"

    "### Challenges with confocal scanning\n",
    "Unlike conventional approaches, a confocalized NLOS system exposes the detector to direct reflections. This can be problematic, because the overwhelmingly bright contribution of direct light reduces the SNR of the indirect signal in two ways. First, after detecting a photon, the SPAD sensor becomes inactive for approximately 75 ns and ignores any photons that strike the detector for this period of time (commonly referred to as the dead time of the device). If the contribution of direct light is too strong, this reduces the detection probability of indirect photons. Second, approximately 0.1% of detected photon events produce a secondary event due to an effect known as afterpulsing. The contribution of direct photons therefore increases the number of spurious photons detected by the SPAD, further reducing the SNR of the indirect signal. \n",
    "To avoid the negative effects of a strong direct signal, a time-gated SPAD could be used for detection to gate out photons due to direct light.16 Given that our SPAD operates in free-running mode, we instead illuminate and image two slightly different points on a wall to reduce the contribution of direct light. The distance between these points should be sufficiently small so as to not affect the confocal image formation model."

    "### System calibration\n",
    "The first calibration step involves aligning the detector and light source by adjusting the position of the beamsplitter to maximize the photon count rate. When perfectly aligned, the strong direct signal significantly reduces the number of indirect photons detected by the SPAD. Therefore, the second step involves slightly adjusting the position of the beamsplitter to decrease the direct photon counts and increase the indirect photon counts originating from a hidden retroreflector placed within the scene (e.g., the exit sign). The SPAD detected between 0.29 and 1 million counts per second for all experiments (i.e., the number of detected events ranged between 2.9% and 10% of the total number of pulses). For the final step, the system scans a 6 $\\times$ 6 grid of points on the wall and uses the time of arrival of direct photons and known galvanometer mirror angles to compute the relative position and orientation of the wall relative to the system."
