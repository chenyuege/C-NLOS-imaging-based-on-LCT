This folder contains the processing codes for the iterative reconstruction
procedure based on the light cone transform. The 'data' directory includes
captured measurements for several scenes, and each scene can be reconstructed
using the 'run_reconstruction.m' MATLAB script. See the script for more 
instructions.
